## 📈 Insight Summary: Retention & Engagement Patterns

During the analysis of student involvement and persistence data, several key patterns emerged that suggest strong correlations between co-curricular engagement and student retention outcomes:

### 🔹 1. Multi-Organization Involvement = Perfect Persistence  
Students involved in **4 or more student organizations** had a **100% persistence rate**, compared to the overall rate of **95.41%**. This suggests that deeper engagement across campus correlates with stronger commitment and retention.

**Recommendation**: Promote multi-org involvement—especially to underclassmen and first-year students—to improve long-term persistence rates.

### 🔹 2. Student Leaders Persist at Higher Rates  
Students identified as **leaders** within organizations showed a **99.09% persistence rate**, outperforming **non-leaders** (93.96%). This performance gap of **5.13%** highlights leadership’s potential role in boosting retention.

**Recommendation**: Expand leadership training opportunities and early leadership exposure—especially for students in at-risk groups.

### 🔹 3. Engagement Matters More Than GPA  
While the **average GPA across all cohorts was 3.38**, GPA did not correlate with retention as strongly as **organizational involvement** or **leadership roles**. Students with lower GPAs but multiple org memberships still showed high persistence.

**Recommendation**: Shift part of the retention focus from purely academic interventions to structured engagement programs and student org onboarding.
